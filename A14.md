### Queue

A queue is basically a linear data structure that works on the principle of **FIFO (First in First out)** which means an element that is enqueued first will be dequeued first. Element is enqueued from the rear end of the queue and dequeued from the front end. The insertion operation in the queue is known as **enqueue** and the deletion operation in the queue is known as **dequeue**.

The queue is used when the operations are to be performed in the manner of First in First out order just like Breadth-First Search. 

For example, there is a line of people in front of the counter in the bank. They will visit the counter by following the queue property i.e. the person who is standing in front will visit the counter first.

## Basic Operations of Queue:	

- **Enqueue**: This function is used to add an element to the rear end of the queue. If the queue is completely filled, then it will be in an overflow condition. The time complexity of the enqueue is O(1).
- **Dequeue**: This function is used to remove an element from the front end of the queue. If the queue is empty, then it will be in an underflow condition. The time complexity of the dequeue is O(1).
- **Front**: This function returns the front element of the queue. The time complexity of this function is O(1).
- **Rear**: This function returns the last element of the queue. The time complexity of this function is O(1).
- **Peek()**: This operation is used to get the value of the element from the front of the queue.


Here are some scenarios for the usage of Queue:

1. When any resource is shared among multiple consumers. Then the process of using the resource is done using the queue. For example, CPU scheduling, Disk scheduling etc.
2. The queue is used in the implementation of various other data structures deque, priority queue, doubly ended priority queue.
3. In networks, there are mail queues and queues in routers/switches.
4. In operating systems, queues are used in 
   - Semaphores
   - Spooling in printers
   - FCFS (First come First serve) scheduling, example: FIFO queue
   - Buffer for devices like keyboards.
5. In the case of transferring the data asynchronously (i.e. it is not necessary to receive and send the data at the same rate) between two processes. For example, IO Buffers, pipes, file IO, etc.

### Some other applications of queue data structure:

- Applied as buffers on playing music in the mp3 players or CD players.
- Applied on handling the interruption in the operating system.
- Applied to add a song at the end of the playlist.
- Applied as the waiting queue for using the single shared resources like CPU, Printers, or Disk.
- Applied to the chat application when someone sends messages to us and we don’t have an internet connection then the messages are stored in the server of the chat application.

## Types of queues:

- **Simple Queue:** In a Simple queue, insertion of the element takes place at the rear end i.e. ENQUEUE, and removal of the element takes place at the front end i.e. DEQUEUE. The simple queue is also called a linear queue.
- **Circular Queue:** In a circular queue, the elements act like circular rings. The working of a circular queue is similar to a simple queue but in a circular queue, the element in the last position is connected to the element in the first position. The main advantage of a circular queue is that the memory will be utilized in a better way.
- **Priority Queue:** In a priority queue, the elements are stored according to their priority, Based on the priority of elements we’ll set our queue accordingly i.e. in ascending order or in descending order.
- **Dequeue:** Dequeue is known as a double-ended queue. In dequeue, the elements can be inserted or removed from both ends.Due to this property, the dequeue may not follow the first in first out property.

## Queue implementation using Array:
For the implementation of queue, we need to initialize two pointers i.e. front and rear, we insert an element from the rear and remove the element from the front, and if we increment the rear and front pointers we may occur error, Due to this, the front pointer may reach the end.
The solution to the above problem is to increase the front and rear pointers in a circular manner.

**Enqueue Operation / Insertion:**
- First, check if the queue is full or not.
- For the first element, set the FRONT pointer to 0.
- Increment the REAR index by 1.
- Add the new element in the position which was pointed by REAR.

**Dequeue Operation / Remove:**
- First, check if the queue is empty or not.
- Return the value which was pointed by FRONT.
- Increment the FRONT index by 1.
- For the last element, reset the values of FRONT and REAR to -1.

**Time complexity:**
- **Enqueue: O(1)**
- **Dequeue: O(1)**
- **Front: O(1)**
- **Rear: O(1)**

**Space complexity:**
**O(N) where N is the size of the array.**

## Queue Data structures: FAQs

1. **What is the queue Data structure?**
A queue is defined as the ordered list in which insertion and deletion are performed at two different ends i.e. REAR and FRONT end.

2. **What are the types of queue data structures?**
There are four types of queue data structures:
Simple queue
Circular queue
Priority queue
Dequeue

3. **What are the REAR and FRONT end?**
A queue is a collection of elements that are added at one end called “REAR” and removed from the other end called “FRONT”.

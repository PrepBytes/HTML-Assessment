In this article, we will learn how to find the factorial of a number in java. The factorial of a number is the product of all integers from 1 to that number. Before moving forward make sure you are familiar with loops in java. 

```
Example:
Enter the number: 5

Output:
A factorial of 5 is 120
```
## Method 1: Find the factorial of a number in java.
In this method, we will learn how to find the factorial of a number in java using a while loop.

### Algorithm to find the factorial of a given number using a while loop

- Create an instance of a Scanner class.
- Declare and initialize the new variable.
- Declare a new variable for the loop and store the factorial of a number.
- Initialize both variables with 1.
- Traverse using a while loop.
- Run the loop till the given number.
- Update the factorial in each iteration of the number.
- Increment the loop variable.
- Print the factorial of a number.

### Code Implementation to find factorial using while loop:

[TABS_R id=10522]

```
Output:
Enter the number: 5
Factorial of the number: 120
```
## Method 2: Java program to find the factorial of a number
In this method, we will use a for loop to find the factorial number.

### Algorithms to find the factorial of a given number using for loop.

- Create an instance of a Scanner class.
- Declare and initialize the new variable.
- Declare a new variable for the loop and store the factorial of a number.
- Initialize both variables with 1.
- Use a for loop to calculate the factorial.
- Update the factorial variable by multiplying it with the loop variable in each iteration.
- Print the factorial of the given number.

### Code Implementation to find factorial using For loop:

[TABS_R id=10525]

## Method 3:  Java program to find the factorial of a given number recursively.
In this method, we will find the factorial of a given number recursively, In this program, we will take input from the user and we calculate the factorial of a number recursively.

### Algorithm to find the factorial of a given number recursively

- Declare a variable to store a number.
- Ask the user to enter the input number.
- Check whether it is possible to calculate the factorial or not.
- If the number is greater than and equal to 0, then call a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the entered number.
- If the number is lesser than 0, print the message that it is not possible to calculate the factorial.
- If the entered number is 0 or 1, then return 1.
- If the entered number is other than 0 or 1, then calculate the factorial by recursively calling the same method.
- Return the result and print the factorial of a given number

### Code Implementation:

[TABS_R id=10526]

```
Output:
Enter the number: 6
The factorial of the entered number is:720
```

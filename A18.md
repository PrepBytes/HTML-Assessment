In this article, we will learn about the addition of two numbers in C++. we will show different approaches to adding two numbers. All these methods do the same thing, that is to add two numbers given by the user or take it on our own. Letâ€™s discuss the C++ program to add two numbers.

## Algorithm to add two numbers in C++

- Start
- Declare variables A, B, and sum
- Read values for A and B
- Add the values of A and B and assigned the result to a sum variable
- Print sum
- Stop

## Method 1: Add two numbers using the arithmetic addition(+) operator
In this method, we will see a C++ program to add two numbers using the plus(+) arithmetic operator.

### Code Implementation to add 2 numbers using arithmetic addition:

[TABS_R id=10527]

```
Output:
The sum of two numbers 10 and 20 = 30
```

## Method 2: Add two numbers using a user-defined function.
In this method, we will see a C++ program to add two numbers in which the user allows to insert the values of two numbers using a user-defined function.

### Code Implementation to add 2 numbers using a user-defined function:


[TABS_R id=10528]

```
Output:
Please enter the First Number: 10
Please enter the Second Number: 20
Sum of Two Numbers 10 and 20 = 30
```

## Method 3: Add two numbers using functions
In this method, we will create a function that accepts two arguments and return the sum of those two arguments. We will call that function inside out the main() function.

### Code Implementation to add 2 numbers using functions:

[TABS_R id=10529]

```
Output:
Please enter the First Number: 10
Please enter the Second Number: 10
Sum of Two Numbers 10 and 10 = 20
```

## Method 4: Add two numbers using recursion
In this method, we will use a recursive function to apply the addition of two numbers. In which the function calls itself from its definition part.

### Code implementation to add 2 numbers using recursion:

[TABS_R id=10530]

```
Output:
Enter Two Numbers: 20 20
Result = 40
```

**Time Complexity:** O(1)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

**Conclusion**

This blog taught us the different approaches to how to add two numbers in C++. For beginners, you must have to practice more coding questions like adding two numbers as these questions help in building logic as well as making your coding stronger. We hope this article will help you to enhance your knowledge and give you a good grasp of C++ programming language. Many companies like TCS, Wipro, Capgemini, and many others ask these basic questions in their interview process. Also, you can check our [MYCODE](https://mycode.prepbytes.com/ "MYCODE") platform to practice more questions on data structures and algorithms.

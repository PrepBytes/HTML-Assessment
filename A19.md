In this blog, you will learn how to add two numbers in java. The resultant sum is displayed on the screen. Adding two numbers often seems to be too easy. We will discuss how to find the sum or addition of two numbers. We have also discussed different ways through which users can provide input, and much more.

## Algorithm for Sum of two numbers in Java:

- Declare two variables.
- Initialize the variables with some values.
- Declare another variable to store the sum of the numbers.
- Apply the mathematical plus(+) operator between two values and store the result.

### Method 1: Standard java program to add two numbers

[TABS_R id=10518]

```
Output: The sum of two numbers is: 50

```
This is a straightforward approach to finding the sum of two numbers letâ€™s have a look at how to find the sum of two numbers in java using the method.

There are two ways to find the sum of two numbers in java using the method

- By using the user-defined method
- By using the sum() method

### Method 2: By using the user-defined method: 
Java allows the user to read the input. We can take two numbers as input from the user and pass them to the user-defined method sum().
Below is the implementation of the program.

[TABS_R id=10519]

```
Output: The sum of numbers 10 and 20 is: 30
```

### Method 3: By using Integer.sum() method:
The integer class provides the sum() method. sum() method is a static method that adds two numbers as per operator.

```
Syntax: public static int sum(int a, int b);
```

[TABS_R id=10520]

```
Output:
The sum of x and y is: 30
The sum of x and y is: 10
```

### Method 4: Java program to add two numbers using command line arguments
Another method to taking input from user is command line arguments. We will discuss the java program to add two numbers where both the numbers are provided by the user using arguments from the command line.

[TABS_R id=10521]

```
Output:
The sum of x and y is: 100
```
**Explanation:** 

Compile the above program using the command javac SumofNumbers.java. After that, run the program by using command java SumofNumbers 50 50.
Where 50 and 50 are command line arguments.

**Conclusion:**

In this article, we have studied how to find the sum of two numbers in Java using different methods. Along with that we have also learned how to take input from user. We hope this blog has helped you to enhance your knowledge regarding the java programming language.

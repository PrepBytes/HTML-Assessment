In this article we will learn about the leap year and how to check whether a year is a leap year or not. We will also learn how to write a code to check leap year program in python.

## What is a Leap Year
A leap year is a year which has 1 extra day compared to ordinary year, meaning it has 366 days in total and 1 extra day lies in the month of february, which means february has 29 days instead of 28 days.

### Mathematical Conditions for Leap Year
The mathematical conditions for the leap year are:

- The year should be divisible by 400.
- The year should be divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100.

 ### Examples of Leap Year
 
1. **1947 is a leap year or not**
1947 is not a leap year as it is neither divisible by 4 nor by 400. It is defying both the conditions of leap year given above in mathematical conditions for the leap year section.

2. **1900 is a leap year or not**
1900 is divisible by 4 and 100 but not by 400. As it is divisible by 4 but also by 100, so 1900 is not a leap year. The condition for leap year is the year should be divisible by 400 or the year should be divisible by 4 but not by 100.

3. **2000 is a leap year or not**
2000 is a leap year as it is divisible by 400. It is satisfying the first condition of leap year given above in mathematical conditions for the leap year section.

4. **2004 is a leap year or not**
2004 is a leap year as it is divisible by 4 but not by 100. It is satisfying the second condition of leap year given above in mathematical conditions for the leap year section.

## Leap Year Program in Python
The following are different method to create leap year program in Python

### 1. Leap Year program in python using calendar module
The Calendar module allows you to output calendars like the Unix cal program and also provides additional functions related to the calendar. Monday is the first day of the week and Sunday is the last day of the week. In terms of weekly index Monday’s index is 0, Tuesday’s is 1, Wednesday’s is 2 Thursday’s is 3, Friday’s is 4, Saturday’s is 5 and Sunday’s is 6. We can also change the first day of the week by using setfirstweekday(integer) method, here the integer is the weekly index of the day you want to make the first day of the week.

In the leap year program of python we will use the isleap() method of the calendar module.

**Syntax:**

```
isleap(year)
```

isleap() method returns the boolean value depending on whether the year is leap year or not. If the year is leap year then isleap() method will return True else False.

**Code for leap year program in python using calendar module**

[TABS_R id=10424]

**OUTPUT:**

```
Enter the year: 2000
Leap Year
Enter the year: 1900
Not a Leap Year
```

### 2. Leap Year program in python using if-else statement

1. Take a year as input from the user.
2. Check if the year is divisible by 400, if yes return true else go to step 3.
3. Check if the year is divisible by 4, if yes go to step 4, else step 5.
4. Check if the year is divisible by 100, if no return true, else go to step 5.
5. Return false.

**Source Code**

[TABS_R id=10425]

**OUTPUT:**

```
Enter the year: 2000
Leap Year
Enter the year: 1900
Not a Leap Year
```

#### Summary

A leap year is a year with 366 days having one extra day in February month making it a month of 29 days.

 Mathematical condition for a year to be a leap year is it should get divisible by 400 or it should get divisible by 4 but not by 100.
 
We can write a leap year program in python in two ways, one using calendar modules’ is leap method and one by simple if-else statement.
